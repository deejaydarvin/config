QUESTION: 1) What would you recommend for working on clear articulation and consistent response with soft dynamics on top of the staff, such as what's called for in the Brahms Academic Festival Overture?

2) If I'm remembering correctly from a masterclass a few years back, you suggested to the group an articulation that's alternative to the usual "too" placement for single tonguing: tonguing on the lip, like on the reed of a clarinet. Could you elaborate on this; is this your go-to articulation? Maybe there's a secret society of lip-tonguers out there ... Thanks!


ANSWER: I'll answer 1 and 2 together
I have found that of all the components that help create style, the front of notes seem to be the most important. ( see my answer to #10). That is created by the "attack". In actuality it's not an attack in the sense of a tympani strike but rather a release. The placement of the tongue is really important for response and clarity. To understand the location we have to realize that Arban was French and the syllable tu is the original meaning, not the Americanized too. With too the tip of tongue is usually at the point where the upper from teeth touch the gum. With tu it is at the bottom of the front teeth. It should be at the back edge of the teeth which can sometimes allow the tongue to touch the lips but NEVER in between or through the lips. This placement allows much faster single tongue speed and response.
As I stated though it's the release of air this really the "attack". Hard tongue or unwanted accents occur because the air immediately drops after the note has been started. To observe and improve this practice Schuebruk graded lip trainers volume 2 attack practice. Do this without the tongue and all dynamics up throughout A on top of the staff. When this is comfortable add the tongue and try not to drop air speed after initial release.

QUESTION: 3) What approach do you take with a student who seems to blow from the neck or throat once he reaches the top of the staff? In the staff and below, he plays quite well with a good sound. He still plays okay up to C or D, but the sound thins out up there presumably due to that neck/throat tension.

ANSWER: The top of the staff is where I consider a break exists. By that I mean around E and then above you must use more air pressure from the diaphragm to play, at minimum, the same dynamic as you play on the notes in the staff. This is more than likely because of a necessarily smaller aperture and even possibly something in the physical make up of the instrument. Most players that have the symptoms you describe are not increasing air pressure (with the diaphragm) so they must constrict the throat much like putting your thumb over the end of a water house to squirt the water faster. The student must create a new habit to go over this break correctly. Slurring exercises like Schuebruk lip trainer grade 2 slurring and my buzzing exercises 6 & 7 address this.

QUESTION: 4) Hi, what daily routine do you recommend, to get the day started before early playing, like orchestra for example. Sorry for the language, english is not my first language.

ANSWER: My first 4 buzzing exercises, Schuebruk attack practice to A on top of the staff and Clark fifth study single and double tongue would be a good start.

QUESTION: 5) What do you think about multiple tones? As in being able to sound clear and resonant in one setting but maybe slightly more airy or "sigh-like" in another. Would this be detriment to a players technique?

ANSWER: No problem as long as you are consciously doing it. I consider this as part of the necessary technique needed for today's music. It's good to think outside the box but make sure the box is sturdy!

QUESTION: 6) How do you develop consistency?

ANSWER: The simple answer is pay attention to EVERY note you play as you play it. This idea tends to be confusing though. Read my text about present time. The best way to understand this is to play, for example, Clark fifth study. Can you play each note without thinking of the next note or the last note you just played? Now can you play listening to the tone to make sure it's the same on each new note. Then do the same with attacks. See what happens! Consistency is 99% MENTAL!

QUESTION: 7) While auditioning, should you play your audition "in the style" of that orchestra, or stick to how you play?

ANSWER: My experience is that if the orchestra you are auditioning for is "an established older orchestra" like New York London etc. you can assume they are listening for a player who can fit in. This applies to section players especially. For principal you have a little more latitude. For other orchestras you should play the way you feel most comfortable. They will ask you to change if they are interested and you do something the committee is not sure about stylistically. My definition of musical hell is to to play your career in an orchestra where the style is opposite of your taste and you have to constantly monitor your playing to fit it!

QUESTION: 8 What is the one fundamental you would teach a beginning trumpet player?

ANSWER: There are obviously many things that need to be addressed, but for me the ability to hear a beautiful clear tone is the first fundamental. This ability needs to be learned. It should be demonstrated to the student and then the student asked to copy. You will learn a lot about what you need to do next, ( air,lip,posture, etc.) in doing this. That being said, I strive for the student to make a clear centered resonant tone in the mid register at mf. This should be the first real goal.

QUESTION: 9) For someone who only occasionally plays in an orchestral setting and spends far more time on a Bb horn, can you suggest some ideas for re-acclamating to the C trumpet and playing with a more "orchestral" technique? Any particular excerpts or exercises one might try during these re-adjustment periods?

ANSWER: I believe classical, Jazz, commercial, etc. are merely styles. If you have command of the components of playing you simply change them to suit the style. That means listening critically to what makes up a trumpet (sound). Trumpet sound is made up of five components: Tone (more later) attack, note length, and intensity (volume and vibrato). Tone is what comes out of the bell and is a mixture of the fundamental (pitch) and overtones. It must be clear, with the most overtones possible at any given dynamic. Sound however, can be dark bright classical Latin, whatever. By modifying these components you can create any style. After coming to Eastman I obviously stopped playing full time in orchestra. But I was lucky enough to perform as guest principal in several top orchestras. It was eye opening to hear how each orchestra was excellent but different. This gave me a chance to hear why and figure how to blend in. The difference is most noticeable by the change of attack and note length. Listen to ANY style trumpeting for note length and attack. Dynamics to a lesser degree. When you can hear the differences, practice your standard Clark etc. trying to copy that. Don't forget note length and attacks are not necessarily connected. Short notes don't always have a sharp attack and long legato notes are not always softer attacks.

Question: 10) When going through an embouchure change, what would you practice and for how long?

ANSWER: Folks going through an embouchure change focus almost all their attention on their lips. We do this for obvious reasons (placement, jaw angle, trumpet angle etc.). We forget the air!! You must practice exercises that emphasize air flow over lip muscle exercises. Low note practice at mf with relaxed airflow for the fist couple of weeks is best. Don't be in a hurry! Two things about lip muscle. First you're now using those muscles in a slightly different way. Second the embouchure is already toned (and fairly strong) from previous playing. Because the muscles are moving differently they tire as if you were a beginning player. But because of muscle tone you won't feel the "burn" the beginning players feel compelling them to stop. We can overdo it easily. To prevent this listen to a break in your response. That will tell you when to stop.

Question: 11) If you were preparing for an orchestral audition today, what approach would you take to separate yourself from the pool of players competing?

ANSWER: That's a tough question. I remember Vince Cichowicz saying "for as long as I've been in this business I'll never understand auditions". So to answer your question what I would do is: Know the orchestral style of the orchestra your auditioning for. It goes without saying we want to play all of the notes but if there's a clam, how you recover tells the committee a lot. Today with the education tools available there are a lot of excellent journeymen players out there who will get all the notes and pretty much the style. However to set yourself apart you have to, in addition, make the drama,humor,etc. paramount. Most players for example play for the obvious ( rhythm pitch tempo dynamics etc.) The artists have internalized the technique and play from the drama they hear in the music. It's not really playing the trumpet it's presenting the emotion. Listen to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (baritone)

QUESTION: 12) How do you practice projection in everyday practice?

ANSWER: Projection is really the function of maximum overtone.
